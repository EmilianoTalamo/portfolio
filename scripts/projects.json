On social networks, anyone supporting this would put green colored circle on their profile picture, but I noticed lots of people that didn't know how to do this easily without relying on apps or using programs on their computers. So in six hours, I coded this simple webpage that lets you upload a photo and put a customizable circle to use it in any social network later on. The site was quite a success, and was used by plenty of people.",
